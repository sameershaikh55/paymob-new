										In 2019, having noticed a dynamic shift in consumer
										behaviour, and the rise in digital payments, they decided to
										develop a payment gateway and accompanying digital
										infrastructure to enable any business to accept payments
										with the same ease and accessibility as their customers were
										making them - thus the smartphone terminal was born. In
										2021, after three years of development, testing and rigorous
										certification processes, Paymob Smart Payments was ready to
										launch.
